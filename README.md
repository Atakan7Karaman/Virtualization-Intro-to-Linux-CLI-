# Virtualization (Intro to Linux CLI)

## Objective

This Virtualization Lab was designed to get us comfortable with the Linux CLI.

### Skills Learned

- How to navigate using the command line interface.
- How to open/read text files.
- How to make new directories and files using the CLI.
- How to create new users and new groups.
- Adding and removing users from groups, and managing permissions.

I started this lab off by trying out some commands that allowed us to our present working directory. I navigated to the Documents directory, and finally, the last command that I input, “cat example.txt” allowed me to see the content of the text document that I had navigated to.

With the last couple of steps, I created a new directory named mydir, copied the example.txt and named the new file newfile.txt, and renamed the example.txt to oldfile.txt. I also moved the newfile.txt to the home directory, and the “ls -l newfile.txt” allowed me to see additional information about the text file.

With the last couple of steps, I have removed the newfile.txt as well as the oldfile.txt, and I have even removed the mydir directory. The last command, “ip r” allowed me to see information about the system’s network interface configurations.

In the last couple of steps I tested out the ping command, and also used the “netstat -tpn” command. The second time was with elevated privileges because of the word “sudo”.

This is the command that we have to use in order to create a new user.

 The last command allowed us to create a new group called accounting.

 In the last couple of steps, I created a new password for the demo user, and I also added the mgs650student account to the group “Students”.

We used some commands to list all of the groups in the system, and then we used a command to remove a user from a group.

The last couple of steps had to do with managing permissions, specifically we learned about the chmod and chown commands. 

### Independent Examination

In this part of the assignment we had to use what we learned so far to adjust the groups, the owners, and the permissions of the virtual lab that we were working on.
